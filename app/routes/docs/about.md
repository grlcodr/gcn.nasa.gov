# About GCN

The General Coordinates Network (GCN) is a public collaboration platform run by NASA for the astronomy research community to share alerts and rapid communications about high-energy, multimessenger, and transient phenomena.

GCN is the established platform for publishing discoveries and follow-up of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), gravitational-wave (GW) compact binary mergers, and high-energy neutrinos. GCN distributes alerts between space- and ground-based observatories, physics experiments, and thousands of astronomers around the world.
